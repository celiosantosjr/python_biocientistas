# Instructions

In this folder you gonna find the most important info about the class
and also the important instructions for different houseworks you gonna
need to deliver.

### Generalities

The file `informações gerais` brings info about the dates, work, dos and don'ts
and other important stuff, I invite you to give it a look.

### Final work

Our work to be delivered in the end of the course or TCC has very strict guidelines,
ooooh (be scared). Actually, is not that hard, but you need to pay attention to 
detail. Please give it a look in the `Instruções.pdf` file for more info.
