# Cheat sheets

These are files with short and intuitive commands and their functions for the most famous
packages we studied in classes. They are cool because in case of quick questions, you can 
always look into them and prepare your code. 

Here, I looked in the internet and selected the best ones for the following packages:

1. Scipy
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Pandas

These are PDF formatted files, which make them portable and readily usable in any platform.
