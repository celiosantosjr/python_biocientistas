# Datasets

This folder contains the datasets available within the sklearn library.
They both are toy datasets:

- `iris.tsv.gz` represents a tab-separated table with data about species
                of iris genus plants and their phenotypes.

- `diabetes.tsv.gz` another tab-separated file with several patients biochemical
                    features and their final blood sugar levels

  Both databases can be used for trying and testing purposes freely.
